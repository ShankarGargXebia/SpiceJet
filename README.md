## Software required for setting up this project:
	1. Install Java7 on your system and update path variable
	2. Install Eclipse 
	3. if you want to execute from command line: Install Maven on your system and update path variable
	4. if you want to execute from eclipse: Install Eclipse-Maven Plugin an Install Eclipse-TestNG plugin
	6. To get source code: Install Git SCM on your system for Git Command line

## How to execute test cases:
	1. From Command line:
		1. Open Terminal and CD to project root directory
		2. To execute all test cases as per current TestNG.xml file enter following command and click enter:
		mvn clean install
		3. To specify conditions and override existing TestNG.xml file:
		mvn clean install -DtestGroups=Base_Outfit:Base_Outfit_1:chrome
			
			a. Here "testGroups" parameter has 3 values seprated by colon
				i.  __First Attribute__: This is the test group we want to execute. for example: Base_Outfit. This should match the column in TestCase excel. This could be comma seprated list if we want to execute multiple test groups in one go.
				
				ii. __Second Attribute__: This is for parallel execution within TestGroup mentioned in first attribute, This could be comma seprated list and test cases in above mentionbed test group will be divided in number of comma seprated values in this field. If testgroupd has 20 test cases and we have 4 values in this field, than test cases will be divided in group of 5 and all 4 threds will execute in parallel.
				No of command seprated enteries in second attribute = No of Threads started to execute the test cases in parallel
				
				iii. __Thrid Attribute__: This is for browser. This could also be a comma separated list. Values could be mix also like chrome,firefox, ie etc.
				No of command seprated enteries in third attribute = No of command seprated enteries in first attribute
				
				Note: This field is of no significance for API Test cases.
			In this example test cases that match "Base_Outfit" in TestGroup column in Test Case excel will be executed in One Thread on Chrome Browser.
			
			We can multiple values in all the attrbutes also:
			mvn clean install -DtestGroups=Outfits07:O1,O2,O3:chrome,chrome,chrome
			here Outfits07 test cases will be divided in Three groups and each child group will be executed on its own chrome browser.
        	__platform__: You can specify platform like Android or iOS.only applicable for Native App Automation. This is not mandatory. Default value for this field is Android and iOS for Browswer containing Android and iOs Respectively.
	    	__platformVersion__: You can specify platformversion like 5.0 for Android or 9.0 iOS.only applicable for Native App Automation. This is not mandatory. Default value for this field is 5.0 for Android and 9.0 for iOS for Browswer containing Android and iOs Respectively.
	    __deviceName__ : You can specify Device like AndroidPhone for Android or iPhone6/iPad Air iOS.only applicable for Native App Automation. This is not mandatory. Default value for this field is AndroidPhone for Android or iPhone6/iPad Air iOS for Browswer containing Android and iOs Respectively.
	    __orientation__: You can specify orientation like orientation or landscape.only applicable for Native App Automation. This is not mandatory.
	    __AUT__ : We need to specify type of AUT also. This is mandatory field and its value could be any one of the follwoing: Web, REST and CT.

	6. Go to node machine\s and open command prompt window with administrator rights
	
	7. Run following command in that
			For Firefox
				java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar -role node -hub http://<HUB_Machine_IP>:Hub_Port/grid/register (It'll launch the node on default port 5555 )
			
			For Chrome
				java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar -role node -hub http://<HUB_Machine_IP>:Hub_Port/grid/register -browser browserName=chrome,maxInstances=5 -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe

			For Internet Explorer
				java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar -role node -hub http://<HUB_Machine_IP>:Hub_Port/grid/register -browser browserName="internet explorer",maxInstances=5 -Dwebdriver.iexplore.driver=IEDriverServer.exe

            For Safari Web Browser (MAC)
                java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.47.1.jar -role node -browser browserName=safari -hub http://forgehub.tribpub.com:4444/grid/register
				
	8. Go to server machine and open browser then type the following url
			http://localhost:4444/grid/console
			It'll show all the connected nodes with configuration details

	9. In Project, open uiautomation.properties and make following changes:
		IsRemoteExecution=true
			
	10.  Now on the server machine open the project folder and type following command of Maven
			mvn clean install
	
	11. It should clean the project and build it, you can check the test cases execution on the nodes.

## Important notes for iOS Native Node Setup and Test case execution:
	1. __Please start Appium Server always first for iOS Native and then after for others.
	   Node sequence should be like below on hub console "http://forgehub.tribpub.com:4444/grid/console":
	   a) http://forge-ios-slave.usa.tribune.com:4723 (iOS Native Node)
	   b) http://EditorUX.usa.tribune.com:4723 (iOS Safari Node)
	2. Execute only one job at a time from Jenkins for each iOS instance like iOS Web (Safari) or iOS Native (Mobile).

## Important notes for Android Native Node Setup and Test case execution:
	1. Execute only one job at a time from Jenkins for each Android Native instance( this is not applicable now)

## Important notes for MAC Safari Node Setup and Test case execution:
	1. Execute only one job at a time from Jenkins for each MAC Safari instance
	2. Gap should be atleast for 5 minutees between 2 MAC Safari Jenkins execution.
